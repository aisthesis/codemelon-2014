<h2>Modifying existing JavaScript for RequireJS <small><?php echo $date; ?></small></h2>
<p>I recently organized all of my JavaScript code into RequireJS
modules and have some notes on why it's worth it to make the necessary changes 
in order to get it set up correctly. While you do have to wrap every file in a <code>define()</code>
function, a solid directory structure probably won't need to be modified (mine didn't), and dependency management
is much easier. For me, the change actually slightly reduced the number of lines of code and cleaned up the 
global scope a bit.
