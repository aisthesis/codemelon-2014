<h2>Reorganizing JavaScript to use RequireJS <small><?php echo $date; ?></small></h2>
<p>I recently took on the project of finally organizing my JavaScript code into RequireJS
modules. I have some notes on why it's worth it to make the necessary changes (to every single file!) 
in order to get it set up correctly and clarify some issues that I didn't find adequately
explained in the documentation and tutorials.
