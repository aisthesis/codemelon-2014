<h2>Multi-tab Chrome extension <small><?php echo $date; ?></small></h2>
<p>Clicking through the same links over and over again for daily viewing the charts of some stocks I follow, 
I eventually decided that this would be a good task to automate but couldn't find a browser extension
that allowed you to open a preset group of links with one click. So, I built a Chrome extension
called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/multi-tab/jifdlmkhpkkaeemdipgekomlmbkbmjjl"
target="blank">Multi-tab</a> to do exactly that.
