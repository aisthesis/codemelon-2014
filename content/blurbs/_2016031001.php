<h2>Predicting stock growth <small><?php echo $date; ?></small></h2>
<p>Machine learning has been used for pattern recognition 
with an astonishing degree of success in a wide range of contexts. Fairly simple algorithms
yield over 90% accuracy in reading hand-written digits, and other algorithms
make it possible to classify objects appearing in digital images
and to identify individuals through facial recognition techniques. 
But predicting market prices of publicly traded
equities proves to be somewhat more difficult because price behavior is subject to
significant unforeseeable fluctuations, or <em>noise</em>. After many failed and some
partially successful experiments, 
we have, however, developed a technique for predicting growth with a reasonably
high degree of accuracy.
