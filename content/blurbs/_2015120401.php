<h2>Machine learning applied to quantitative finance <small><?php echo $date; ?></small></h2>
<p>Some friends and I have been working recently on an automated investment
system. Our first challenge has been trying to make accurate
predictions. It turns out that it is not at all easy to make predictions that
are statistically better out of sample than just always predicting average growth. After experimenting
with every metric we could find and multiple machine learning techniques, we have now come up
with an algorithm yielding predictions with a consistently reduced out-of-sample standard error.
