    <p>Some friends and I have been working for a good while now on an automated investment
    system. The first problem is making accurate
    predictions. It turns out that it is not at all easy to make predictions that
    are better out of sample than just always predicting average growth. After experimenting
    with every metric we could find, we came up
    with an algorithm yielding predictions with a consistently reduced out-of-sample standard error.
    While we can't in this case share the details of the algorithm, we can share its results.</p>
